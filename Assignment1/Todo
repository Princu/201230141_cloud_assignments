### Assignment 1

* The folder for assignment 1 consists of the program "add.c" written to calculate the sum of two numbers.

* The assembly code for the program has been generated using "gcc inline assembler":

        gcc -S -masm=intel -m32 add.c (add.s renamed to 32_bit_add.asm)
        gcc -S -masm=intel -m64 add.c (add.s renamed to 64_bit_add.asm)

* The interpretor is written in convertAssembly.cpp and convertAssembly.h. The program that translates the 32_bit_add.asm to 64_bit_add.asm is translator.cpp which depends on convertAssembly.cpp for the    helper functions.

* You can run the translator using the following commands (All the files should be in the same folder) :

        g++ translator.cpp convertAssembly.cpp -o translator
        ./translator 32_bit.asm output.asm

* On comparing it can be seen that output.asm and 64_bit_add.asm are same.

* You can also check the assembly code's validity using the following command (rename output.asm to output.s first) :

            gcc -o prog-x86_64 output.s
            ./prog-x86_64

If it exits without giving any errors, that proves the assembly code's validity. (You can also use gdb to run the binary).
